## Connect to Different Platforms

First, we will help you choose between multiple crypto platforms for automated trading. There are several factors to consider: the price of fees, trading volume, data accuracy, etc. After deciding where the bot will get data from and how it will work, we provide the necessary instruments to get exposure to the market.


## Anticipate Forthcoming Transactions

By scanning the mempool and checking unconfirmed transactions, the bot will place an order. We will help you pick the indicators for the bot to follow, the assets it will trade, the exchanges it will support, and situations where it acts.



## Run Back Tests

We will help you see how the strategy would work by running tests. In this stage, we will make sure that the bot functions without any flows.


## Develop a Trading Model

In this stage, we will help you turn your trading ideas into rules, build a strategy and write it into smart contracts. To carry out analysis and follow the model, the bot will access historical and real-time analysis of cryptocurrencies.


## Be the First to Make an Order

Building robust algorithms and a highly responsive system, we will launch a bot that overtakes competitors, being the first to carry out a transaction. Our front-running bot development company provides complex solutions to create a custom system that is user-friendly and secure.
